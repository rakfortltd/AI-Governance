    "gov_policies": "The AI Governance Policy (Document #1) outlines requirements for risk assessment, human oversight, and transparency. However, it does not mention an AI Management System (AIMS) or external certifications/audits as claimed in the answer.",
    "gov_accountability": "Policy Document #1 states the AI Governance Officer (AIGO) is responsible for oversight. It mentions risk assessment but not a cross-functional committee or RACI matrix, indicating a defined but not fully detailed accountability structure.",
    "leadership": "The policy mentions an AI Governance Officer (AIGO) for oversight, but lacks explicit details on top management's direct involvement in directing strategy, setting KPIs, or budget allocation for AI governance. Further clarification is needed.",
    "scope": "The AI Governance Policy (Document #1) mandates that all AI projects undergo a formal risk assessment, implying a need to document purpose, context, scope, use-case boundaries, and impacted groups. However, it does not specify measurement or external assurance.",
    "jurisdiction": "The policy mandates risk assessments classified per the EU AI Act (Doc #1, Sec 3), indicating awareness of EU regulations. However, it doesn't detail a dynamic compliance map or automated adaptation.",
    "risk_classification": "Policy Document #1 mandates formal risk assessment classified per the EU AI Act. It also requires human oversight for high-risk systems. However, it does not specify mapping for all potential harms or third-party validation.",
    "risk_specific": "The policy mandates risk assessments classified per the EU AI Act (Doc #1, Sec 3). However, it does not detail the specific risks identified, assessed, or prioritized, nor does it mention a central risk register or review committee.",
    "docs_traceability": "Policy #1 mandates model cards and data sheets, but does not specify versioning, data provenance, model governance, decision logs, incident records, or conformity assessments.",
    "audit_trails": "The policy mandates model cards and data sheets (Doc #1, Sec 5), implying record-keeping. The answer states audit trails are generated and retained per regulations (Answer 2), indicating a defined process.",
    "human_oversight": "Policy Document #1 mandates HITL for high-risk systems and clear escalation paths. However, it does not specify SLAs or mention external audits for this process.",
    "user_rights": "Policy Document #1 mentions transparency and human oversight for high-risk systems, but does not detail user notification methods or specific rights for appeal, objection, or explanation. The answer introduces concepts not present in the provided policy.",
    "explainability": "Policy Document #1 mandates model cards and data sheets for production models, implying a level of transparency. However, it does not explicitly detail technical measures for end-user or regulatory explainability.",
    "technical_controls": "The policy mandates risk assessments (Sec 3) and human oversight for high-risk systems (Sec 4), implying mitigation strategies. However, it does not detail specific controls like bias mitigation, fallback mechanisms, adversarial testing, or cybersecurity safeguards.",
    "independent_validation": "The provided policy documents (Document #1) do not contain any mention of conformity assessments, external audits, or third-party certifications. Therefore, no evidence supports the claim made in the answer.",
    "monitoring_metrics": "The policy mandates risk assessments and specifies human oversight for high-risk systems (Doc #1, Sec 3 & 4). However, it does not detail specific metrics or benchmarks for monitoring accuracy, fairness, robustness, security, or ethical compliance.",
    "continuous_improvement": "The policy mentions risk assessment and human oversight for high-risk systems, but lacks specific procedures for continuous monitoring, incident management, learning from failures, or system updates/retirement as requested in the question. The answer mentions a process for continuous improvement and post-mortems, but this is not detailed in the provided policy documents.",
    "prohibited_practices": "The policy mandates risk assessments classified per the EU AI Act (Doc #1, Sec 3), implying awareness of prohibited practices. However, it doesn't explicitly detail a process for verifying avoidance of specific prohibited practices.",
    "legal_alignment": "The policy mandates risk assessment aligned with the EU AI Act (Document #1, Section 3), indicating awareness of regulatory alignment. However, it lacks detail on how this alignment is maintained across multiple jurisdictions or through automated tools.",
    "data_governance": "Policy #1 mentions data sheets for models, implying data governance. However, it doesn't detail data governance frameworks, privacy impact assessments, or stakeholder communication processes. The answer references external certifications and processes not present in the provided policy."
